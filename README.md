Engineered NLP-based Web Search chat engine answers userâ€™s queries and generates coherent sentences in English as response. Performed web scraping of Google search results using Selenium to extract the closest answer to the query via NLP methods (SpaCy and NLTK).

The program handles questions from any domain, and provides answers in complete sentences.
The program takes an approach similar to AskMSR system proposed by MicroSoft in 2001, and simply reformulates the
question as a series of "answer patterns" that you then search for in Wikipedia, where you are hoping to find an exact match to one of your patterns.
